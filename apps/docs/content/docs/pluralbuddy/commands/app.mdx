Explain why PluralBuddy is not an app.

## Usage

```
pb;app
```

## Response
### This server uses an application named PluralBuddy, a _plurality_ bot. 
This bot serves people that would like to serve under a different identity while being on the same Discord account.

However, PluralBuddy uses a Discord feature named webhooks, which requires all messages sent by webhooks to have the \`[APP]\` tag, or on older clients, the \`[BOT]\` tag. However, users proxying with PluralBuddy are not bots; infact PluralBuddy takes steps to ensure they aren't.

Many servers have rules specific to PluralBuddy. Please check in with a server administrator regarding these topics if you have further questions.

<Callout type="warning">
    This command can be disabled by server administrators.
