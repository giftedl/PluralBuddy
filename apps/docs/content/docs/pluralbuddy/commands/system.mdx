### Application commands

Usage without any other sub-commands is supported with `pb;system`, however is only allowed when not using Discord application commands. All root commands that have sub-commands must be used with prefix commands.

If you need to, it is recommended to use `pb;system info` (`/system info`) to get the same information as just running `pb;system`.
