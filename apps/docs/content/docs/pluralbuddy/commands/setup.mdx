After running this command, you will be prompted into a process to create a new system. You will be able to pick from a few options to start a new system.
- Import from PluralKit: Importing from PluralKit requires you to put the data of your system export into a modal.
- Import from PluralBuddy: Importing from PluralBuddy requires you to put the data of a prior system export into a modal.
- Create New System: Creating a new system from scratch requires you have the [required options](#creating-system-options)

<Callout title="Deleted Attachments" type="warning">
    If you used `-mi` when deleting an already exported system (from PluralBuddy), all attachments will be broken when importing and will need to be reuploaded.
</Callout>

### Creating system: options

 - System name: PluralBuddy requires a system name to create a system. It must be at _least_ 3 characters and at _most_ 20 characters long.
 - System privacy: You can set the values that are public to other users when they see your system profile. There are no requirements for these.
 - System tag: System tags are required depending on if the server you setup the system in requires them or not. System tags are additions to the webhooks that clearly makes a webhook name able to be recognized by system.
