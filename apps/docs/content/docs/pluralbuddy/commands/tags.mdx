## Sub-commands
_All arguments in `<value>` format are required. All arguments in `[value]` are optional. Attachments can be uploaded directly and privately using Discord application commands as opposed to uploading directly to the command message used._

<Callout type="warning" title="Display Names with Spaces">
    Display names with spaces will require using quotes to enclose them. 
    
    __On iOS, quotes are often replaced with special quotes that aren't recognized with PluralBuddy, which will mess up the command.__
</Callout>
