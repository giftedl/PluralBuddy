PluralBuddy has many features that are cattered directly towards server administrators, moderators, and managers. Many of them elevate the experience of users on your server, or employ a strategy which makes PluralBuddy align with your server outline.

## Blacklisted Channels/Roles

PluralBuddy allows both the blacklist of channels in your server and the blacklist of specific roles.
 - Blacklisted channels doesn't allow users to proxy when in a specific channel.
 - Blacklisted roles doesn't allow users to proxy if their host account contains a specific role.

Blacklisted roles will see the following message in DMs when attempting to proxy or use a command:

<BlacklistedRoleExample />

Blacklisted channels will see the following messages in DMs when attempting to proxy or use a command:

<BlacklistedChannelExample />

### Commands

They can be enabled with the following commands:

- `pb;server-config blacklist add-channel <channel>` - Add channel where PluralBuddy will not work.
- `pb;server-config blacklist add-role <role id or mention>` - Add role where having this role will disallow users from proxying.
- `pb;server-config blacklist list` - List all blacklist items.
- `pb;server-config blacklist remove-channel <channel>` - Remove channel where PluralBuddy will not work.
- `pb;server-config blacklist remove-role <role id or mention>` - Remove role where having this role will disallow users from proxying.

## Role Containers

Role containers are a feature which allow users to be identified by their role. For example, if your users would want to see who is a moderator or not, role containers would look like this on a user:

<RoleContainerExample />

Role containers have unique characteristics like how they wont remain after sending one or more consecutive messages and being directly attached to a role which makes them special compared to doing other more manual alternatives.

### Commands

Role containers can be modified or enabled with the following commands:

- `pb;server-config role-containers view` - View all role containers
- `pb;server-config role-containers set-contents <role id or mention> [contents]` - Sets contents of a role container. If blank, contents will be cleared.
- `pb;server-config role-containers set-color <role id or mention> [hex color|"role"]` - Sets color of a role container. If color is "role", it will be set to the primary color of the role. If blank, color will be cleared.
- `pb;server-config role-containers set-location <role id or mention> <top|bottom>` - Sets location of a role container, either to the top or bottom of a proxied message.

## Error Log

PluralBuddy stores logs when things go wrong related to permissions or other issues in the server. For example, if the server enforces a guild tag, that will both appear as an error in the server log and send a notification to the user.

They can be easily cleared, and usually aren't super critical issues. If you run into critical issues, please contact [PluralBuddy Support](https://gftl.fyi/discord).

You can access the error log using `pb;server-config errors`.

## Proxy Delay

Usually, PluralBuddy tries to proxy messages as quickly as possible (\<600ms speeds). However, this creates an offset issue which may occur where moderation bots may not recogonize or may run into an error cleaning up messages from PluralBuddy-proxied messages due to the speed of proxies.

PluralBuddy's solution to this is **proxy delays**. They work by waiting a certain amount of time before proxying any message sent in a guild, and after this delay, will check if the originally sent host message still exists, and if not, **the proxy will be canceled.**

This often will allow moderation bots to get a chance to delete messages before PluralBuddy will eventually delete the host message regardless.

<Callout type="warning">
    Proxy delays can be **at most** 2.5 seconds.
</Callout>

### Commands

- `pb;server-config set-proxy-delay <proxy-delay>` - Set proxy delay.

## Server managers

Server managers have the power to use any management related commands with PluralBuddy, besides users without Administrator or Manage Guild.

### Commands

- `pb;server-config manager-roles add <role id or mention>` - Add manager role which is able to access PluralBuddy server configuration commands. **Requires Administrator or Manage Guild to use.**
- `pb;server-config manager-roles list` - List current manager roles.
- `pb;server-config manager-roles remove <role id or mention>` - Remove manager role from PluralBuddy. **Requires Administrator or Manage Guild to use.**

## Custom Prefixes

PluralBuddy allows you to set custom prefixes besides `pb;` and `pb!`, which are the default ones.

### Commands

- `pb;server-config prefixes add-prefix <prefix>` - Add a PluralBuddy prefix
- `pb;server-config prefixes list-prefixes` - List all PluralBuddy prefixes
- `pb;server-config prefixes remove-prefix <prefix>` - Remove a PluralBuddy prefix

## Enforce System Tag

Enforcing system tag will enforce system prefixes/tags for all users proxying with PluralBuddy. Commands will not require system tags to be used unlike blacklists.

### Commands

- `pb;server-config require-tag <on|off>` - Whether to enforce system tags or not.
