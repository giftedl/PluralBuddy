PluralBuddy uses many terms which may be confusing in nature, which is what this page is supposed to explain.

## Component User Interface

PluralBuddy, uses a technique called a Component User Interface, essentially meaning instead of using commands, many actions can also be preformed using native Discord buttons, forms, and other related components.

This can be done due to Components v2, a new Discord components UI API addition, which allows configuration menus to be very comprehensive

Examples of this in action are the following commands:

- `pb;system config` - Opens the visual configuration for your system.
- `pb;server-config view` - View server configuration interface
- `pb;nudge-preferences` - Configure settings about nudging

## Nickname Proxy Mode

The nickname proxy mode allows users to automatically change their nickname after proxying as a certain alter. This can make typing indicators and other native signals show the alter's name as opposed to the hosts name.

### Nickname Format

Nickname formats tells PluralBuddy how your nicknames should be formatted. By default, it is `@%username%`.

- In a nickname format, the following placeholders are replaced:
  - `%username%` is replaced with your alters username
  - `%display%` is replaced with your alters display name.
- Nickname formats can be at most 40 characters

Nickname formats can be set using `pb;system nickname-format`:
- `pb;system nickname-format <new format>` - Set the nickname format for alters, where `%username%` is the username and `%display%` is the alter display name in `new format`.
