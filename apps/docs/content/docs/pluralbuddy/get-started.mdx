Hello, and welcome to PluralBuddy! This page will show you how to get started with PluralBuddy.

<InlineTOC items={toc}>Table of Contents</InlineTOC>

## Setting up a system

First, you need to setup a system with the following command:

```
pb;setup
```

[That command](/docs/pluralbuddy/commands/setup) will guide you through importing, or creating a new system on PluralBuddy.

## Creating a new alter

Second, you need to create an alter to use in PluralBuddy.

```
pb;system create-alter solar 🌻 Solar 
```

<Callout type="info" title="Naming Conventions">
    Alters are similar to "members" on PluralKit, or "tuppers" on Tupperbox.
</Callout>

<Callout type="idea" title="Alter Usernames">
    Notice how alters have usernames, and display names as well. Unlike other plural bots, alters are identified
    by their username with no spaces or special characters, and not a randomly generated ID.

    This avoids common problems with requiring spaces in alter names when using their relevant commands.
</Callout>

## Proxy as an alter

Alters have two different ways of expressing "proxying" on PluralBuddy:

 - By changing the nickname of the user depending on the alter proxying
 - By sending a webhook with the name and avatar of the alter proxying, which is more traditional in bots like PluralKit

<Callout type="warning">
    Setting the nickname of an alter as the primary and _only_ way to show an alter currently proxying
    may not be the best decision due to how past messages will be unidentifiable due to how when your nickname changes
    it changes on _all_ messages.
</Callout>

You can set the current proxying mode on an alter by using corresponding alter commands.

```
pbc;edit-alter proxy-mode solar webhook
pbc;edit-alter proxy-mode solar nickname
pbc;edit-alter proxy-mode solar both
```

You can also set proxy tags, which are ways to specify based on a messages content when a certain alter is supposed to be proxying. For example, you can use a proxy tag like `text -solar`, which means any text with `-solar` at the end will be proxying under that alter. This also works the same way for suffixes.

```
pbc;edit-alter add-proxy-tags solar
```

## Set a banner and avatar

When proxying as an alter, you can also have an avatar that appears in the webhook when a message is sent. You can also have a banner that appears in the profile of your alter.

```
pbc;edit-alter avatar solar https://pb.giftedly.dev/image/solar.png
pbc;edit-alter banner solar https://link.to.website/
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Storage Limitations">
    All attachments for alters and systems must be under a megabyte (1mb) if you upload an attachment. Anything put as a link has an unlimited
    storage limit.
</Callout>
<Callout title="Attachments">
    You can also just upload the picture that you'd like to use in the message of the command when using avatar or banner commands.
